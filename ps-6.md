# Problem Set 6 (Due Sunday, April 6th at 8pm)

## Problem 1
Create a list called 'numbers', that contains the whole numbers from 1 to 10.

## Problem 2
Create a function called 'first-square' that takes a list of numbers, and returns the square of the first number.

## Problem 3
Create a struct called 'account', with the fields 'id', 'company' and 'is-up-to-date?'. Then create three accounts called 'account1', 'account2' and 'account3'. Fill in reasonable values for the fields. The field 'is-up-to-date' is a boolean and so should get either #t or #f.


## Problem 4 
Create a function named 'squares', that takes a list of numbers, and returns a list of their squares. 
For example, the function would take '(1 2 3 4) to the list '(1 4 9 16).


## Problem 5
Using the 'account' struct from problem 4, create a function that takes a list of accounts, and returns a list of their names.

## Problem 6
Continung with the 'account' structure, create a function that takes a list of accounts and returns a list of all the accounts that are not up to date.

## Problem 7
Continuing with the 'account' structure, create a function that takes an account and a list of accounts and creates a new list which is the old list with the given account added to the beginning of the list. 



## Problem 8
Continuing with the 'account' structure, create a function that takes a list of accounts and returns a list of all the accounts that have an id greater than 2. Hint: Use the 'filter' function. 


## Extra Credit
Create a function that takes a list and a number and returns the list with the last number replaced with 100.
Hint: Think of all the functions we've learned that act on lists.
