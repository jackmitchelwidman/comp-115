# Problem Set 4: 

#Paddles (Inspired by Pong)

1. Create a **paddle** (like in Pong) and place it on the **right side** of the screen, in the **middle vertically**.

2. Modify the paddle from Problem 1 so that:
   - It moves **up** when you press the **up arrow**.
   - It moves **down** when you press the **down arrow**.

3. Create a **circle** and place it in the **middle** of the screen. When the program starts, the **circle should move horizontally** towards the **right** side of the screen and stop when it **touches the wall**.

4. Combine Problems 2 and 3:
   - A **circle** should be in the **middle** of the screen.
   - A **paddle** should be on the **right side**, in the **middle vertically**.
   - **No movement** is necessary.

5. Start with the code from Problem 4:
   - When the program starts, the **circle should move horizontally** until it **touches the paddle**, then stop.

6. Start with the code from Problem 5:
   - The program should do the **same** as Problem 5.
   - Now, **activate the paddle**:
     - The **up arrow** moves it **up**.
     - The **down arrow** moves it **down**.
   - **Ignore** what happens if the circle hits the paddle (for now).
