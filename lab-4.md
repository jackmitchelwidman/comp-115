# Lab 4 Problems

## Moving Shapes

1. Create a **green circle** that starts near the **top left** of the screen and moves **horizontally** across the screen until it is no longer visible.

2. Create a **red circle** that starts near the **top left** of the screen and moves **vertically** down until it is no longer visible.

3. Create a **blue triangle** that starts near the **top left** of the screen, moves **horizontally** across the screen until it reaches the **halfway point**, and then stops.

4. Create a **black square** that starts near the **top left** of the screen, moves **horizontally** across the screen until it reaches the **midpoint**, then starts falling **vertically down** the screen until it is no longer visible.

5. Find an image of a **cat** and a **dog** online. Assign:
   - The cat to a constant called `cat`.
   - The dog to a constant called `dog`.

   You can drag the images directly into the code. Position the **cat** near the **top left** of the screen and have it move **horizontally** until it reaches the **halfway point**. At this point, something magical happens â€“ the **cat turns into a dog**! Then, the dog **drops vertically** until it is no longer visible.

6. Place an **image of a dog** in the **middle** of the screen. When the program starts, the **dog should start getting bigger and bigger**.

7. Place a **cat** in the **middle** of the screen. The program should behave as follows:
   - When you press the **up arrow**, the cat **moves up**.
   - When you press the **down arrow**, the cat **moves down**.
