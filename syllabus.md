## Course Description & Objectives  
Programming is more than just writing code—it is a way of thinking, problem-solving, and creating. This course introduces students to the fundamental principles of programming, focusing on problem decomposition, algorithmic thinking, and computational logic. By the end of the course, students will:

- Understand core programming concepts such as variables, control structures, functions, and data structures.
- Develop the ability to design, implement, and debug simple programs.
- Gain familiarity with problem-solving techniques and algorithmic reasoning.
- Learn best practices for writing clear, efficient, and maintainable code.
- Build confidence in approaching new programming challenges independently.

This course is designed for students with little to no prior programming experience. However, those with some background in coding will still find value in refining their skills and deepening their understanding of computational problem-solving.

## Grading Breakdown
Your final grade will be determined as follows:

- **60% – Problem Sets**  
  Weekly programming assignments that reinforce key concepts and encourage hands-on learning.

- **35% – Final Project**  
  A comprehensive coding project demonstrating your grasp of the course material.

- **5% – Participation in Labs**  
  Engaged participation in lab sessions where you will apply concepts in a collaborative setting.

## Support & Office Hours
**You are not alone in this course.** If you ever feel like you're struggling to keep up, please reach out to me as soon as you feel your grasp of the material slipping. My role is to support you, and we will work together to help you succeed. Whether it's a quick question, a more in-depth discussion, or guidance on assignments, I encourage you to take advantage of office hours or reach out via email.

**TA Support:** Charles Pasca will also be available to help during TA office hours, so make use of this additional resource!

## Expectations & Policies
- **Collaboration:** While discussing concepts with peers is encouraged, all submitted work must be your own.
- **Late Work:** Extensions may be granted under extenuating circumstances, but you must communicate in advance.
- **Academic Integrity:** All students must adhere to Wesleyan's academic honesty policies.
