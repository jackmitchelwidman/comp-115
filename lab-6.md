# Lab 6 - Manipulating Lists



## Problem 1 
Create a struct called 'name'. The fields should be 'first', 'middle', 'last'. 
Now create a struct called 'address'. The fields should be 'number', 'street', 'city', 'state', 'zip'.
Now create a struct called 'student'. The fields should be 'id', 'name', 'address', 'test1', 'test2'. The id field should contain a positive integer. The 'name' field should contain a name object (i.e. an instance of the struct 'name'). The address field should contain an address object. The two test fields should contain a number betweem 0 and 100. Once you have created the student struct, create three student objects (i.e., three instances of the student struct).

## Problem 2
Using the code from problem 1, create a list of students called 'students'. Make at least three students in the list. Write an expression that gives a list of the last names of the students in the list.

## Problem 3
Create a function that takes a list of students and returns a list of the grades for test 2. 

## Problem 4
Create a function that takes a list of students and returns a list of those students who passed test1. Let's say passing is 65.
